# wxMathPlot
The famous wxMathPlot created by  David Schalig, Davide Rondini, with minor clean up with less complexity of use

- Gathered all necessary includes in the header file.
- To use it, just add mathplot.h to your include directory and add mathplot.cpp to you project
- ztcMP.h and ztcMP.cpp is the same example mp1.cpp presented by the original autor with modification to work with the new rearrangement.
- I tested it on Windows 11, MS VS2022.
